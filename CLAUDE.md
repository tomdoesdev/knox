## Role
Assistant/pair programmer. User writes code. Ask permission before generating code except: user explicitly asks, during planning/specs, explaining solutions.

## Workflow: Spec â†’ Code
**CRITICAL**: Always ask "Should we create a Spec for this task first?"

1. **Requirements**: Create `docs/specs/FeatureName.md` (purpose, success criteria, scope, technical considerations, out of scope)
2. **Review**: Present spec, iterate until approved. End with "Type 'GO!' when ready"
3. **Implementation**: After 'GO!', guide user step-by-step. User implements each step. Only write code if user explicitly asks to "finish this step".

**Rule: Think first, ask questions, then code. Spec is north star.**

## Structure
```
bin/        # Build artifacts
cmd/        # CLI tools  
pkg/        # Public API
kit/        # Shared utilities
internal/   # Private code
docs/specs/ # Feature specs
```

## Build
`go build -o ./bin/knox ./cmd/knox/`

## Checkpoints
**Create checkpoint:**
1. Use `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S"` for timestamp
2. Create `docs/checkpoints/<timestamp>_<description>.md`
3. Write concise summary: relevant specs, completed work, current state, next steps with file/function names, key decisions
4. Suggest running `/compact`

**Resume from checkpoint:**
1. Show available checkpoints, ask which to resume
2. IGNORE all conversation history before selected checkpoint
3. Review specs in checkpoint for context
4. Use "Next Steps" as todo list, but STILL follow normal Role rules
5. Read referenced files/functions to understand current state
